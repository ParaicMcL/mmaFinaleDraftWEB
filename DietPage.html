    <h2>Vegan Protein Diet Plans </h2>
    <section class="col_details">
    <img width="500" height="340" src="mmaImages/Vegetables.jpg" alt ="Veg">
    <p>Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, insects, and the flesh of any other animal).
    It may also include abstaining from eating all by-products of animal slaughter.
    So if you're looking to build muscle on a vegan diet, make sure your 
    meals are loaded with high-protein options like seitan (made from wheat gluten), tofu, lentils, and beans (chickpeas are great). These foods are low 
    in fat and high in fiber—and they don't contain any cholesterol!</p>
    <p>Research has shown that there is no difference in the outcomes between those who eat a plant-based diet vs omnivorous diet in the ability to build muscle with adequate protein intake,” said Hilbert</p>
    <p>Since plants are loaded with many other important nutrients — including fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals — a diet centered around them can also aid in building, maintaining, and protecting new tissues in other ways, as outlined in The Plant-Based Advantage.</p>
    <p>Nate Diaz. Having had major successes in the octagon throughout his career, Nate Diaz has actually been vegan since the age of 18. Diaz, whilst already embracing a number of MMA achievements, shot to superstar status after being the last minute replacement in a fight against Conor McGregor.</p>

    <section class="col_details">
    <img width="500" height="340" src="mmaImages/proteinDiet.jpg" alt ="Protein">
    <p>Animal proteins, such as meat, eggs, and milk, are complete proteins, meaning they provide all of the essential amino acids our body needs.
    Animal products provide the highest-quality protein sources.</p>
    <p>Animal proteins are complete proteins. That means they contain all the essential amino acids that you need in your diet. Plant proteins are often, but not always,
    incomplete sources of protein, There are benefits and concerns with both types of protein.</p>
    <p>Why do humans eat meat and other animal products? Animal products can improve human nutrition and heart and bone health. Meat,
    such as poultry, beef, pork and fish, supply many nutrients. These include protein, B vitamins (niacin, thiamin, riboflavin, and B6), vitamin E, iron, zinc and magnesium.</p>
    <p>'GSP' was famous for always staying in shape. His training and diet helped him achieve the same.
