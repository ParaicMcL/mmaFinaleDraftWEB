<h2>The 3 Most Exciting WeightClasses</h2>
<section>

    <h3>The Heavyweight </h3>
    <section class="col2_details">
    <img width="500" height="500" src="mmaImages/jonJones.jpg" alt ="The Heavyweight">
    <p>The heavyweight division in mixed martial arts (MMA) generally groups fighters between 206–265 lb (93.4–120.2 kg). Although many ambiguities exist within the lowerweight classes regarding division naming and weight limits, the heavyweight division is, for the most part, uniform.</p>
<p>While Fedor Emelianenko's legacy has been run through the mud by Dana White and UFC over the years, he's still the greatest heavyweight of all time. The Russian never stepped foot in a UFC cage, but Emelianenko's prime had him fighting in PRIDE.</p>
<p>There are 25 fighters currently on the UFC's Heavyweight roster and this is the list that ranks them. This list is not going to be based on a "who beat whom three years ago" which ends up with the same top five fighters as everyone always sees.</p>
<p>Jones is a two-time undisputed UFC light heavyweight champion, first holding the title from March 2011 to April 2015 and then again from December 2018 to August 2020. Jon Jones won Fighter of the Year in 2011. Jones briefly held the interim UFC light heavyweight title in 2016 and in 2017.</p>

    <h4>The Middleweight </h4>
    <section class="col2_details">
    <img width="500" height="500" src="mmaImages/issy.jpg" alt ="The Middle Weight">
    <p>Just when it seemed to be inching back towards stability, the Ultimate Fighting Championship middleweight division reverted to its characteristic chaos.</p>
<p>In the headliner of UFC 293 on Saturday in Sydney, Australia, Sean Strickland upended Israel Adesanya by unanimous decision in a massive upset that somehow didn’t feel like one in the moment.
     Round after round, the American used a crisp one-two, patience and relentless forward pressure to completely stymie one of the most dazzling strikers the sport has ever seen. In less than half an hour, the narrative had turned from what Adesanya would need to do after beating Strickland in order to resume his march on divisional GOAT status, to how on earth a challenger who was not even the promotion’s first choice managed to make a historic upset look so easy.</p>
<p>Of course, to those who have been paying attention over the years, Saturday’s eye-opening main event was merely a return to form for one of the UFC’s weirdest divisions. Because middleweight is so synonymous with Anderson Silva, owner of one of the longest, most dominant title reigns in MMA history, it can be easy to forget what a mess it had been before his arrival. Like its fellow unloved stepchild, the lightweight division, 
    the UFC middleweight division had a long period during which there was no champ at all, in this case the two-and-a-half-year gap from October 2002, when Murilo Bustamante defected to Pride Fighting Championships, until February 2005.</p>

    <h5>The Lightweight</h5>
    <section class="col2_details">
    <img width="500" height="500" src="mmaImages/lightweight.jpg" alt ="The Light Weight">
    <p>The UFC's lightweight division was reinstated at UFC 58 after falling into disuse following UFC 49. Sean Sherk, a former welterweight contender, defeated Kenny Florian at UFC 64, becoming the first UFC lightweight champion since 2002.</p>
    <p>The lightweight limit, as defined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission and the Association of Boxing Commissions is 155 lb (70 kg).</p>
    <p>Conor Mc Gregor was a former featherweight and lightweight double champion in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He is the first UFC fighter to simultaneously hold titles in two weight divisions. Conor was formerly the lightweight and featherweight champion of Cage Warriors.</p>
<p>Known for his counter-striking skills, striking precision and knockout power, the majority of McGregor's victories in mixed martial arts have come by way of knockout or technical knockout via punches. His signature style off arena is to repeatedly engage in trash talk against his opponents, which has led to earning him the moniker The Notorious. Throughout his career, McGregor has become the subject of many controversies due to his behaviour.</p>
